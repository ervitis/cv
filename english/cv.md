## Introduction

Senior Software Engineer & Platform Engineer

I consider myself a self-taught and earnest person. My favorite sentences in any IT project are: "divide and conquer", "Don't repeat yourself" and "Fail fast, learn fast".
I love being a team player and I am always looking for the best practices in software development and DevOps.
From December 2023 I began building a personal project using Google Cloud Run using Golang and ReactJS with Terraform. The name of the project is __ikigaikintore__.
